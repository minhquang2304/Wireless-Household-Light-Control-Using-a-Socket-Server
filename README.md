# This is one of my side projects that uses ESP01 and Socket Server Protocol

Using the Socket Server protocol, this project uses an ESP01 with a relay module to wirelessly control a 220V lightbulb. 

The development process was done on PlatformIO in VSCode. 

This is my first hobby project and I learned a lot building it
